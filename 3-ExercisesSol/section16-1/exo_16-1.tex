	When $z = 0$, each $(x, y, 0)$ is mapped to $\bi + 2 \bj$. So in the $xy$-plane, we should have the same vectors. This is exactly the plot I.

	\exo{18}
	When $x$, $y$, and $z$ are small, the vector $x\bi + y \bj + z \bk$ has a small length. If $x \neq 0$, $y = \neq 0$, and $z \neq 0$, then the vector $x\bi + y \bj + z \bk$ is pointing in the opposite direction of the origin (like a vector emanating from the origin, starting at the point $(x, y, z)$). Also, we see that if $x = y = z = 0$, then we obtain the zero vector. The only plot that has the zero vector is the plot II.

	We have
		\begin{align*}
		f_x (x, y) = x \quad \text{ and } \quad f_y (x, y) = -y .
		\end{align*}
	So the gradient vector field is $\nabla f = \bF (x, y) = x\bi - y \bj$. The picture below shows a plot of the vector field.

	The function is $f(x) = x^2 + xy$. So its gradient is $\vec{\nabla} f (x, y) = (2x + y) \vec{i} + x \vec{j}$. The $x$-coordinate of the vector field is zero if $y = -2x$. In this case, the vector field looks like
		\begin{align*}
		\vec{\nabla}f (x, y) = -(y/2) \vec{j} .
		\end{align*}
	Also, when $y > -2x$, then the $x$ coordinate of the vector field is positive and all the vectors in the vector field must point to the east (to the right, in the same direction to the positive $x$-axis). When $y < -2x$, then the $x$ coordinate of the vector field is negative and all the vectors in the vector field must point to the west (to the left, in the opposite direction to the positive $x$-axis).
	
	So the corresponding representation is IV.

	The vector at $(x, y) = (1, 3)$ is $\vec{F}(1, 3) = \left\langle 1, -1 \right\rangle$. So, the new position of the particle would be 	
	\begin{align*}
	\left\langle x_1 , y_1 \right\rangle = (1, 3) + \Delta t \vec{F} (1, 3) = \left\langle 1, 2 \right\rangle + 0.05 \left\langle 1 , -1 \right\rangle = \left\langle 1.05 , 1.95 \right\rangle .
	\end{align*}
